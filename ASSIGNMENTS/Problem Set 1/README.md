<h3>1. What were your results from compare_cow_transport_algorithms? Which algorithm runs faster? Why?</h3>

Time taken by greedy : 0.0<br>
Number of trips using greedy : 6<br>
Time taken by brute : 1.29600000381<br>
Number of trips using brute : 5<br>
Greedy algorithm runs faster.
It runs faster because it doesn't iterate through all possible ways of solving the problem before giving the solution. It arrives at a local optima which in most cases is not the global optimal solution.

<h3>2. Does the greedy algorithm return the optimal solution? Why/why not?</h3>

No, because as said above, it doesn't iterate through all possible ways of solving the problem before giving the solution. It arrives at a local optima which in most cases is not the global optimal solution.

<h3>3. Does the brute force algorithm return the optimal solution? Why/why not?</h3>

Yes, because it literally goes through all the posssible ways of solving the problem and then gives the best one, which usually takes more time.
